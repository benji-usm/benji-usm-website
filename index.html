	<p>My name is Benjiman Joel Wesigwa, a Ugandan artist based in penang malaysia at the moment undergoing bachelor (hons) degree in contemprary arts at Universiti Sains Malaysia. I completed my A-Levels in 2018 while still a teen in Nairobi, Kenya, where I studied the arts at Rusinga School Nairobi. I also took part in treks, sports including football, hockey, basketball, and volleyball, as well as the athletics team. I value outdoor activities in addition to art and music. I play in several bands, beginning with acoustic and electric guitar, drums, and bass. My critical observations of how people's varied facial expressions revealed a range of emotions were sparked by these joyful and spirited actions. I drew many portraits as I considered the stories that people's faces may tell till it became my specialty. I became into a portrait painter, capturing the feelings of others in my works of art.
